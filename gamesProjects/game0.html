                <p class="desc-project">
                    <i>The Hex Perplex</i> is the first indie game I made as a personal project. With our team consisting of only 2 people, this experience gave me an insight as to how many roles actually need to be filled for developing a game. Some important lessons I took from this project:
    
                    <ul>
    
                        <li><b>Schedule playtests as frequent as possible.</b> Many small decisions can make or break the player's experience. For 2D platformers in particular, it's imperative that both jumping and the core mechanic simply <i>feel</i> good to perform. It's very difficult to get something right the first time, and so the best way to figure out if it's designed well is to actually test it with real players.</li>
    
                        <li><b>Always try to stay within scope.</b> It's very easy to plan much more than what's possible with a given time frame. Ideally a team should have a hierarchy of priorities. Plans shouldn't be made for another two mechanics if the first one hasn't been polished (or if it's not a fun mechanic in the first place).</li>
    
                    </ul>

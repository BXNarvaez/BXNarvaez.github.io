        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Project's short description will go here. Just like the previous short description, it explains the metaphor, genre and difficulty to outsiders. In addition to this info, Links, Contributions, a postmortem-like "What I learned", and other info.</p>
        <h3>Dev Info</h3>
        <p>Explains the tools used, the team size, and the duration of the project's development</p>
        <h3>Other Info</h3>
        <p>Is this a game? An art piece? Explain it here.</p>
        <h3>External Links</h3>
        <p>links to external pages. For example, an Itch.io page</p>
        <h3>Contributions</h3>
        <p>this should cover EVERYTHING you did during this project's development, in full detail, especially if you worked in a team.</p>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>What did you learn from this experience/project that you took with you/can be beneficial when you work with a new team? It's very important to be self reflective. Another thing is, what would you have done if you had more time to work on this project?</p>

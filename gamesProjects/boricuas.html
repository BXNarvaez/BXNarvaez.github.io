                <p class="desc-project">

                    Before it was a video game, the idea for <i>Project "Boricuas"</i> was an interactive art game. This idea got scrapped halfway through production for a number of reasons, which left me with only 5 months left. I decided to leverage the available resources I had in order to scout, hire, and fund a small team. This is how I found myself in the role of manager for a short time. Some important lessons I took from this project:

                    <ul>

                        <li><b>As a team manager, it's important to trust your teammates' abilities.</b> There was an early fear of overworking the team and bombarding them with tasks. Once things started picking up I gave them a lot more to do. Upon doing so the feedback I received was not to worry so much. To them the work was just enough to handle.</li>

                        <li><b>Cultural representation in games is very important, but it alone is not grounds for an interesting game.</b> The games industry is entering an era where any lack of diversity or inclusivity is simply unacceptable. I try my best to bring my culture into the work I do, and once I had a metaphor of revelation and ignition for decolonization and cultural preservation, it became very hard for me to see any other path for this project.</li>

                    </ul>

                </p>

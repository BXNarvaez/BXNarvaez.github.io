                </div>
    
                <p class="desc-project">
    
                    <i>Clock Out!!</i> is the first game I designed in a professional environment on a team of more than 4 people. Development was a true test for my skillset. I also learned to listen to each of my teammates. Some important lessons I took from this project:
    
                    <ul>
    
                        <li><b>Do not get married to any ideas pre-production.</b> In the games industry, developers' first concern must be if their metaphor/idea for a game grabs an audience. Before it was a fighting game, <i>Clock Out!!</i> was an idle clicker, and after that it was an RPG. Also, the only animals were crows collecting artifacts in a desert. Many ideas that sounded good to the team but to no particular group of players had to be scrapped, and this was a very healthy practice that stung, but yielded much better results.</li>
    
                        <li><b>Identify the "first fun."</b> What's the first thing the player will be doing when they pick up the game? It's likely the thing they'll be doing a lot of. This mechanic has to <i>feel</i> really fun to do. In this case the "first fun" is punching, and it was not as snappy as it is in the final version.</li>
    
                    </ul>
